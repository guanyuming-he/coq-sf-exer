(** nth_error_informal
  We induct on n.
  When n = 0,
  we show that l must equals to nil.
  Suppose for the sake of contradiction that 
  it equals h :: t instead, then by the definition    of length, length l equals S (length t), not equal to 0, a contradiction.

  Thus, l equals nil. Thus, by definition, nth_error l n = None.

  Now suppose inductively for n
 length l = n â†’ @nth_error X l n = None  
 is true,
 then, if length l = S n, we show that l must equal to h :: t and length t must equal to n.

We have two cases, if l equals nil, then by definition it's impossible.
If l equals h :: t, then length l = S (length t). But it equals S n, then we have length t = n.

Expand the definition of nth_error, because S n != 0, it expands into 
nth_error t n, which by the inductive hypothesis is None.

We can now close the induciton.
